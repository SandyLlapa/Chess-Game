How to compile and run program:
- Open the provided files in a IDE like IntelliJ
- The game will take place in the Game.java file
- Run program and follow the printed instructions
 

Assumptions: For the pawn promotion method, it is assumed the player will not choose a pawn to promote the pawn they are already playing as. For the game itself, it is assumed the player will input a starting point and destination point that is within the range of the board game. It is also assumed the player will not pick a starting point that has no chess piece on it.

Bugs/defects: After a king has been captured, the program will still asks the player to input their next move, but this move will not be executed. Once the player has done so, the program will properly end the game.
